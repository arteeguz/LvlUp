        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            We are a team of four dedicated students hailing from CUNY Colleges, each bringing our own unique talents and passions to the table. Our diverse backgrounds in art, history, game design, and technology converge to give birth to a unique ideaâ€” "Artful Duel."
While many see card games as a mere pastime, we recognized them as an avenue for storytelling, a medium to convey a narrative as compelling as any novel or movie. Our love for art, combined with a deep appreciation for history, led us to conceptualize a game that wasn't just about strategy and winning. It was about embarking on a voyage across the sands of time.
"Artful Duel" is more than a title; it's a promise of an odyssey. As players delve into the game, they are transported to bygone eras, from the hauntingly beautiful Renaissance period to the revolutionary sentiments of the Baroque. Through each card, players encounter legendary artists like da Vinci, Van Gogh, and Frida Kahlo, learning not only about their masterpieces but also the stories, struggles, and passions behind them.
But it's not just a passive journey. The game's mechanics allow players to pit these artists against one another, imagining epic duels that span centuries. Every card play isn't just a game move; it's a clash of art styles, eras, and legacies.
And as players immerse themselves in these battles, they not only engage in strategy and gameplay but also in a deeper appreciation of art and history. They come to understand the sacrifices artists made, the revolutionary techniques they introduced, and the indomitable spirit of creation that drives human progress.
We invite players not just to play but to experience, learn, and, most importantly, to celebrate the rich tapestry of art and history that has shaped our world. Join us in this celebration, and let the "Artful Duel" begin!
